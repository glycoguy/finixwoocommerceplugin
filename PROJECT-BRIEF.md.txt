# Finix WooCommerce Subscriptions Plugin - v1.7.0 Implementation Project

## Project Overview
I'm building a WordPress plugin that integrates Finix payment API with WooCommerce Subscriptions.
This plugin handles subscription payments using credit cards and Canadian EFT (bank transfers).

## Current Status
- Current version: v1.6.2
- Target version: v1.7.0
- Location of current code: `./current-plugin/`

## What Needs to Be Done
Implement ALL changes documented in `./reference-docs/DELIVERY-SUMMARY-v1.7.0.md`

Key changes include:
1. Add new Tags system (`class-finix-tags.php`)
2. Update API class with structured responses and payment state handling
3. Implement backend buyer identity creation
4. Add fraud session ID support
5. Enhance error handling throughout

## Important Constraints
- This plugin runs ALONGSIDE the regular Finix gateway (for non-subscription purchases)
- Gateway ID must be different: `finix_subscriptions` (not `finix`)
- Customers need to add descriptions that show on receipts
- Must support both credit card and Canadian EFT formats

## Reference Documentation
All implementation details are in `./reference-docs/` folder:
- DELIVERY-SUMMARY-v1.7.0.md (start here - overview of all changes)
- ARCHITECTURAL-REVIEW-v1.7.0.md (technical review)
- CRITICAL-FIXES-REQUIREDv1_7_0.md (must-fix issues)
- EXPECTED-VS-ACTUAL-v1.7.0.md (detailed code comparisons)
- QUICK-REFERENCE-v1.7.0.md (quick reference guide)

## How to Approach This
1. Read DELIVERY-SUMMARY-v1.7.0.md first to understand what needs to be done
2. Work through changes file by file
3. Test each major change before moving to the next
4. Keep me informed of progress

## Testing
After implementation, I need to:
- Upload plugin to WordPress test site
- Run test transactions (card and bank)
- Check WooCommerce logs
- Verify tags appear in Finix Dashboard

## Experience Level
I'm a beginner coder. Please:
- Explain what you're doing
- Ask questions if anything is unclear
- Provide clear instructions for any manual steps I need to do
