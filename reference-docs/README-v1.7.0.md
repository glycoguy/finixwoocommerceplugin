# Finix WooCommerce Subscriptions v1.7.0
## Production-Ready Release with Critical Fixes

---

## 🎯 What Is This?

This is **version 1.7.0** of your Finix WooCommerce Subscriptions plugin, now with **production-ready features** that fix 3 critical issues found when comparing your plugin to the official Finix plugin.

**In short:** Your plugin now works like a professional payment gateway should.

---

## ⚡ What's Fixed?

### 1. Backend Buyer Creation (CRITICAL)
**Before:** Plugin trusted frontend AJAX to create buyer identities  
**After:** Buyers are ALWAYS created on the backend during checkout  

**Why it matters:** No more silent payment failures, full audit trail, secure handling

### 2. Payment State Handling (CRITICAL)
**Before:** All payments marked "complete" immediately  
**After:** Proper states - PENDING for ACH, SUCCEEDED for cards  

**Why it matters:** ACH payments no longer incorrectly show as complete when still pending

### 3. Tags for Transaction Tracking (CRITICAL)
**Before:** No way to track Finix transactions to WooCommerce orders  
**After:** Every transaction tagged with order ID, coupons, source, version  

**Why it matters:** Can now reconcile payments, filter by coupon usage, debug issues easily
