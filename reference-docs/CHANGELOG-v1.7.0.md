# Finix WooCommerce Subscriptions v1.7.0 - PRODUCTION READY RELEASE

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL UPDATE - DO NOT SKIP THIS VERSION

Version 1.7.0 fixes **3 critical production issues** that could cause payment failures, incorrect order statuses, and reconciliation problems. This is a mandatory update before processing any real transactions.

---

## What's Fixed (The Critical Issues)

### 1. ✅ Backend Buyer Identity Creation
**Before (v1.6.2):** Plugin trusted frontend AJAX to create buyer identities, which could fail silently
**Now (v1.7.0):** Buyer identities are ALWAYS created on the backend during checkout processing

**Why This Matters:**
- No more silent payment failures
- Full audit trail of all buyer creation attempts
- Secure handling of customer data
- Proper error messages when things go wrong

### 2. ✅ Payment State Handling
**Before (v1.6.2):** All payments marked as "complete" immediately, even ACH transfers that take days
**Now (v1.7.0):** Proper state handling:
- **SUCCEEDED** (card payments) → Order completed immediately
- **PENDING** (ACH/bank) → Order marked "on-hold" until cleared
- **FAILED** → Order marked failed with detailed error
- **CANCELED** → Proper cancellation handling

**Why This Matters:**
- ACH payments no longer show as complete when they're still pending
- Inventory isn't reduced prematurely
- Customers get accurate order status
- Webhook handling works correctly

### 3. ✅ Tags System for Transaction Tracking
**Before (v1.6.2):** No way to track which Finix transactions belong to which WooCommerce orders
**Now (v1.7.0):** Every API call includes tags:
- Order ID
- Subscription ID
- Coupon codes
- Order date
- Plugin version
- Source tracking

**Why This Matters:**
- Can reconcile Finix Dashboard with WooCommerce orders
- Can filter transactions by coupon usage
- Makes debugging 10x easier
- Required for proper bookkeeping

- Matches official plugin implementation

### 5. ✅ Enhanced Error Handling

## What If Something Goes Wrong?

### Payment Fails After Upgrade

1. **Check WooCommerce Logs:**
   - Go to: WooCommerce → Status → Logs
   - Look for: `finix-subscriptions-api` log
   - Find the error message

2. **Common Issues:**
   - **"Buyer creation failed"** → Check API credentials
   - **"Token association failed"** → Check Application ID
   - **"Transfer creation failed"** → Check Merchant ID

3. **Rollback if Needed:**
   - Deactivate v1.7.0
   - Reinstall v1.6.2
   - Report the issue with log details

### Orders Stuck "On Hold"

**This is CORRECT for bank/ACH payments!**

- ACH payments take 3-5 business days to clear
- Order will automatically update when payment clears (via webhook)
- Check Finix Dashboard for payment status

### Tags Not Appearing in Finix

1. **Check:** Is Tags class loaded?
   - Look in logs for "Finix WooCommerce Subscriptions v1.7.0 initialized"

2. **Check:** Is payment completing?
   - If payment fails, tags won't be created

3. **Verify:** API response structure
   - Check logs for actual API response
