    title: Finix API Reference
    description: API Reference Documentation for the Finix API. Includes sample API requests and responses.
---

The Finix API is resource oriented, relying heavily on common REST principles. Our API uses JSON encoded requests and responses.

You will receive separate Sandbox and Live accounts, as well as corresponding API credentials to access the Finix API.

---

## Authentication

To communicate with the Finix API, you must authenticate your requests via HTTP Basic Authentication with a `username:password` combination, which you can get from your Finix Dashboard. If you do not have a Dashboard yet, you can test our APIs with the Sandbox credentials below.

{% table %}

-   Parameter
-   Value

---

-   Sandbox Username
-   `USsRhsHYZGBPnQw8CByJyEQW`

---

-   Sandbox Password
-   `8a14c2f9-d94b-4c72-8f5c-a62908e5b30e`

{% /table %}

```shell {% title="Request Format" %}
curl "https://finix.sandbox-payments-api.com/" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Finix-Version: 2022-02-01" \
    -u USsRhsHYZGBPnQw8CByJyEQW:8a14c2f9-d94b-4c72-8f5c-a62908e5b30e
```

---

## Environments

Finix provides two environments with distinct base URLs to make API requests.

1. A Sandbox environment for developing and testing your integration.
2. A Live environment for processing payments.

These environments are entirely separate and do not share API Credentials.

{% table %}

-   Environment
-   Endpoint URL

---

-   Sandbox
-   `https://finix.sandbox-payments-api.com`

---

-   Live
-   `https://finix.live-payments-api.com`

{% /table %}

{% admonition type="info" name="Live Access" %}
To get access to the Live environment, please reach out to your Finix point-of-contact.
{% /admonition %}

---

## HTTP Codes and Errors

Finix uses HTTP codes to communicate whether requests succeeded or failed. Requests to Finix's API return responses within less than one second.

However, communications between card networks and processors can increase response latency. Additionally, response latency for card-present devices can be higher depending on how quickly buyers complete the transaction on payment terminals.

Due of this, requests to the Finix API have a maximum timeout of 5 minutes.

For more details, see [Error Codes](/additional-resources/developers/implementation-and-testing/error-codes/). Also, you can [test for specific errors and responses](/additional-resources/developers/implementation-and-testing/testing-your-integration/).

{% table %}

-   Code {% width="10%" %}
-   Definition {% width="35%" %}
-   Explanation {% width="55%" %}

---

-   `400`
-   Bad Request
-   We could not parse your request. Verify you are providing valid JSON.

---

-   `401`
-   Unauthorized
-   We could not authenticate your request. Verify your `username` and `password` are correct.

---

-   `402`
-   Upstream Processor Error
-   Errors caused by 3rd-party service(s).

---

-   `403`
-   Forbidden

---

-   `404`
-   Not Found
-   We could not find the specified resource.

---

-   `405`
-   Method Not Allowed
-   The specified resource does not support the HTTP Method used to submit the request.

---

-   `406`
-   Not Acceptable
-   The server could accept the submitted request. Confirm how the request was formatted and submitted.

---

-   `409`
-   Conflict
-   The submitted request conflicts with the current state of the server.

---

-   `422`
-   Unprocessable Entity
-   The parameters were valid, but the request failed. Usually, the error involves misunderstanding of how to perform the request (e.g., creating a transfer with a seller that is not-yet-approved).

---

-   `500`
-   Internal Server Error
-   We had a problem with our server. Try again later.

{% /table %}

---

## Idempotent Requests

The `Authorization` and `Transfer` resources both have an `idempotency_id` field. Use this field to ensure the API Request is performed **_only once_**.

Why is this important? We've all experienced a checkout page that hangs on a request or payment, and feared that if we refresh or submit the payment again, we'd be charged twice.

Finix removes this ambiguity with the `idempotency_id`. You or the user can generate a unique ID that can be included as an `idempotency_id` with the usual request payload. If anyone attempts a request with the same `idempotency_id`, the response will raise an exception.

By passing an `idempotency_id` in the body of your requests, you can be rest assured that when you create an `Authorization` or `Transfer`, the user will be protected from potential network issues.

`idempotency_id` is available on the following three endpoints:

-   `/transfers`
-   `/authorizations`
-   `/transfers/{id}/reversals`

{% admonition type="warning" name="`idempotency_id` scope" %}
`idempotency_id` checks against previous requests made on the same endpoint.
{% /admonition %}

---

## Query Parameters

Every Finix resource (e.g., `Authorizations`, `Transfers`) can be listed and reviewed using `GET` requests. Additionally, every endpoint has query parameters available to help you filter the resources that are returned.

See the following example of how to query the `Transfers` endpoint for `Transfer` resources with `type: DEBIT`.

```shell {% title="Query Parameter Example" %}
curl "https://finix.sandbox-payments-api.com/transfers?type=DEBIT" \
    -H "Finix-Version: 2022-02-01" \
    -u USsRhsHYZGBPnQw8CByJyEQW:8a14c2f9-d94b-4c72-8f5c-a62908e5b30e
```

---

## Tags

All Finix resources (e.g., `Authorization`, `Transfer`) let you include `tags` to add key-value metadata to your Finix API resources. For example, when creating a Transfer, you might include `customerId: Customer123` to tag the Transfer with your internal customer ID. You can update tags as many times as needed, as well as filter resources by tags.

```json {% title="Tags Example" %}
{
    ...,
    "tags": {
        "card-type": "business card",
        "order_number": "H-1257",
        "customer_order_reference": "order1234",
        "item_type": "hardware",
        "vendor": "finix"
    }
}
```

The `tags` object accepts up to 50 `key: value` pairs to annotate resources with custom metadata.

-   Maximum character length for individual `keys` is 40.
-   Maximum character length for individual `values` is 500.

{% admonition type="warning" name="Special Characters" %}
Finix does **_not_** allow special characters on tags (e.g., `\`, `,`, `"`, `'`)
{% /admonition %}

---

## Versioning

As Finix improves our products and features, we will make changes to our APIs. When breaking changes are made to Finix's API, we may release a new dated API version.

The API version your requests use controls how API responses and webhooks behave (for example, the values you see in responses and the parameters you can include in requests). For more information, see [Versioning](/additional-resources/developers/authentication-and-api-basics/versioning/).

## Payment Instruments

A `Payment Instrument` resource represents the payment details of a credit card or bank account. Payment details get tokenized multiple times and each tokenization produces a unique `Payment Instrument`.  <br/><br/> A `Payment Instrument` is associated with a single [`Identity`](#Identities). Once a `Payment Instrument` is created, the `Identity` it's associated with can't be changed. <br/><br/> Including an address when creating a `Payment Instrument` can lower interchange on credit card transactions. <br/><br/> Related Guides: [Using Hosted Fields](/guides/online-payments/payment-tokenization/tokenization-forms), [Getting Started](/guides/getting-started)

## Disbursement Rules

For the Payouts product, when a payout is executed, such as a Push-To-Card or ACH transaction, Finix checks the transaction against velocity rules and balance rules.

Rules establish limits on transactions. For example, there may be a daily transaction limit of 100 transactions (`count_limit`) or a monthly volume limit of $100,000 (`volume_limit`). If a transaction exceeds any defined limit, the transaction is rejected. 

Rules are set for entities involved in transactions, including the application, senders, and recipients.

The "Application" represents the customer to whom Finix is applying the rules. Application rules are set solely by Finix and are applied to every single transaction.

You can establish rules for "senders" and "recipients," referring to the parties involved in transactions:

- In the case of a `PULL_FROM_CARD` or `PULL_FROM_ACH` transaction, sender rules are applied (either card or ACH rules). The "target" of the pull is referred to as the "sender," specifically the customer of Finix's client. 
- Conversely, in the case of a `PUSH_FROM_CARD` or `PUSH_FROM_ACH` transaction, the recipient rules are applied (either card or ACH rules). The "target" of the push is referred to as the "recipient," which is, in turn, the customer of Finix's client.


### List Disbursement Rules

 - [GET /disbursement_rules](https://docs.finix.com/api/disbursement-rules/listdisbursementrules.md): Retrieve a list of  resources linked to an  / . Currently, there is only one  object per application / platform.

Each `merchant` has a `merchant_profile`. <br/><br/> When a `merchant` gets created, a `merchant_profile` also gets created. This new `merchant_profile` automatically receives a new `risk_profile` and `fee_profile` that are copies of the risk and fee profiles on the `application_profile`. <br/><br/> Related Guides:
