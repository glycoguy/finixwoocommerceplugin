## Payments Overview

Finix supports Interac, Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover payments for Canadian merchants. All transactions must be processed in Canadian dollars (CAD).

## Online Payments

You can use our existing API calls and low-code/no-code features in Canada. Finix's Payment Links, Checkout Forms, Subscriptions are supported for USA and CAN merchants.

## In-Person Payments

**In Person Payments in Canada is currently in pilot and not generally available.** To participate in the pilot, you must reach out to [Finix Support](mailto:support@finix.com).

### Supported Devices

Finix currently supports the following two certified devices in Canada:

- [**PAX A800**](/guides/in-person-payments/select-your-device/pax-a800)
- [**PAX A920 Pro**](/guides/in-person-payments/select-your-device/pax-a920-pro)


### Cardholder Language Selection

Cardholders can toggle between English and French on the terminal when processing a transaction.

## Interac Payments

Interac is the domestic debit network in Canada. Debit cards issued by Canadian banks typically display the Interac logo, even when co-branded with Visa or Mastercard.

Regardless of co-branding, all Canadian debit transactions are routed through the Interac network when processed in Canada.

Payment Instruments associated with Interac cards will have a `brand` value of `INTERAC`. You can find all potential values for the `brand` field in the [Payment Instrument API Reference](/api/payment-instruments/createpaymentinstrument#payment-instruments/createpaymentinstrument/t=response&c=201&path=&oneof=0/brand).

Interact Payment Instruments can only be used for card-present transactions and do not support card-not-present transactions.

### Interac Sales

All Interac payments must be submitted as sales and are authorized and captured in one request. Interac does not support multi-step authorization and capture flows.

That means:

- The `POST /authorizations` flow is not supported for Interac transactions.
- Attempting to use `POST /authorizations` with an Interac card will return an error. Example response below


Sample Response:


```json

    "total": 1,
    "_embedded": {
        "errors": [
            {
                "logref": "c5a343f2egf4f37b",
                "message": "Authorization AUhKLUbEwkVFfDECA9Aom71A was declined.",
                "code": "DECLINED",
                "failure_code": "TRANSACTION_NOT_PERMITTED",
                "failure_message": "The transaction was declined because the card or transaction type is not permitted. The cardholder needs to use a different type of card or attempt a different transaction method.",
                "_links": {
                    "authorization": {
                        "href": "https://finix.sandbox-payments-api.com/authorizations/AUhKLUbEwkVFfDECA9Aom71A"
                    },
                    "self": {
                        "href": "https://finix.sandbox-payments-api.com/authorizations"
                    }
                },
                "authorization": "AUhKLUbEwkVFfDECA9Aom71A"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### Refunds for Interac transactions

Refunds for Interac transactions must be performed **in person** using a supported terminal and the **same card** that was used in the original transaction. If the card is unavailable, merchants may offer store credit or cash as an alternative refund method.

The following demonstrates how to initiate a refund on a Standalone Terminal, via API, or via the Finix Dashboard.

Standalone
On a Standalone Terminal, navigate to the transaction you wish to refund and select **Create Refund**. The terminal will prompt for the amount you wish to refund and for the card to be presented.

## Settlements

Interac transactions are settled independently from other card networks. When a merchant processes both Interac and non-Interac transactions, Finix will generate **two separate settlements**:

- One settlement for all Interac transactions
- One settlement for all other card brands (such as Visa, Mastercard, and Discover)


This separation ensures compliance with Interacâ€™s clearing and settlement rules and helps merchants reconcile their payouts accurately by card network.

### Funding Schedule

The table below outlines funding timelines for sales created by Canadian merchants, based on when the sale is created (relative to the 7 PM PST cutoff) and the currency or card type used.

| Card Type | Created Before 7 PM PST | Created After 7 PM PST |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| Domestic Cards | 1 business day | 2 business days |
| International Visa | 2 business days | 3 business days |
| International Mastercard | 1 business day | 2 business days |
