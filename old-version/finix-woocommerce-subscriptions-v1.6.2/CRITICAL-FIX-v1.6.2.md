# v1.6.2 - COMPLETE FIX FOR BLOCKS CHECKOUT

## üö® What Was Wrong

Your v1.6.1 test failed with this error:

```
Payment processing error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'tokenize')
```

## Root Cause Discovered

The plugin was **missing the WooCommerce Blocks integration class entirely**. This meant:

1. ‚ùå Finix.js library was never loaded on blocks checkout
2. ‚ùå Payment method wasn't properly registered with WooCommerce Blocks
3. ‚ùå No Application ID field in settings
4. ‚ùå No way to initialize Finix for tokenization

The `finix-blocks.js` JavaScript file existed but had NO PHP code to load it!

## ‚úÖ What's Fixed in v1.6.2

### 1. Created Missing Blocks Integration Class
**File:** `includes/class-finix-blocks-integration.php` (NEW FILE!)

This class:
- Registers payment method with WooCommerce Blocks Store API
- Loads Finix.js library from CDN
- Loads the blocks JavaScript file
- Passes Application ID and settings to JavaScript
- Properly integrates with WooCommerce Blocks lifecycle

### 2. Added Application ID Settings
**Updated:** `includes/class-finix-gateway.php`

Added new settings fields:
- Test Application ID
- Live Application ID
- Getter method: `get_application_id()`

### 3. Changed Gateway ID (No More Conflicts!)
**Old ID:** `finix`  
**New ID:** `finix_subscriptions`

This allows the plugin to run in parallel with your existing Finix gateway without conflicts.

### 4. Added AJAX Handlers for Finix.js Tokenization
**Updated:** `includes/class-finix-gateway.php`

New AJAX actions:
- `finix_associate_token` - Associates Finix.js token with identity
- `finix_create_bank_instrument` - Creates Canadian bank account instruments

### 5. Added API Methods
**Updated:** `includes/class-finix-api.php`

New methods:
- `associate_token()` - Links tokenized card with identity
- `create_bank_instrument()` - Creates bank account payment instruments

### 6. Updated Main Plugin File
**Updated:** `finix-woocommerce-subscriptions.php`

- Includes blocks integration class
- Registers with WooCommerce Blocks
- Updated version to 1.6.2
- Updated gateway class name

### 7. Fixed Finix.js Initialization
**Updated:** `assets/js/finix-blocks.js`

- Proper async initialization with Promise
- Better error handling
- Checks if Finix is loaded before tokenizing
- Provides clear error messages
